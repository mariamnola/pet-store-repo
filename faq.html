<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h4>1. What kind of products do you sell?</h4>
<p>We sell an assortment of natural food, treats and toys for dogs and cats. We also sell supplements, grooming care items, apparel, and miscellaneous pet-related items (beds, poop bags, etc.) for dogs and cats.</p>

<h4>2. Can you handle aggressive dogs?</h4>
<p>Yes we can. Often pets play up when their owners are around and its best to leave them with us. In the event that a dog is aggressive we will require them to be muzzled and may ask you or your helper to assist.</p>

<h4>3. How long does it take to groom?</h4>
<p>It usually takes between 45min and an hour. However badly matted dogs and cats can take significantly longer and we therefore have a surcharge for badly matted pets. If your pet has not been groomed before or is groomed infrequently, they may be nervous and it may take longer.</p>

<h4>4. Do you clip nails?</h4>
<p>Yes we do. It forms part of our standard groom. Please note that if your dogs nails are very long we will only be able to take off a short amount. Cutting them to short, even when long, will cause them to bleed. Similarly, if your dogs nails are short we will not cut them shorter.</p>

<h4>5. My dog hates being washed - what can I do to clean him?</h4>
<p>Most pets aren't a particular fan of being washed. Not because they do not like water, but because it feels unnatural and they often don't understand what's happening. For pets that can't stand being washed, there are several Dry Shampoo Sprays. These can simply be sprayed upon theeir coats, and dried off with a towel after having set in a while.Except for the sprays, there are also have Grooming Powders, which have a similar method of application. The powder has to be spread upon the coat, but can be dried off after a few minutes. No water needed!</p>

<h4>6. Is there a product that helps for my dog's smell?</h4>
<p>Even though we all love our dogs, sometimes they get this bad 'dog smell' that no one likes! We have several products that can help for this problem, one being our odor neutralizing shampoos. Depending on which shampoo range you prefer, we also have the Quick Clean Dog spray that could be a good alternative.This can be sprayed upon the dog's coat and will mask the smell. It also has a cleaning function, which means using this spray will take up less time than washing your dog does.</p>

<h4>7. How do I pick the right shampoo for my dog?</h4>
<p>Determining which shampoo would suit your dog best, can be difficult. The best thing is to choose a shampoo based on your goal. If you want to solve a skin problem, a special need/care shampoo is probably best. If you prefer your dog to smell like he has just returned from the grooming salon, then a premium shampoo would be most suitable. Our Beaphar Shampoo Ranges consist of three ranges that will serve your every need. </p>

<h4>8. My cat keeps getting fleas - where are they coming from?</h4>
<p>Fleas spend the majority of their lives not on your cat, but in the home environment. Flea pupae can survive for many months and continue to hatch into new adults which then infest cat. You may have treated your cat, but if you have not treated your household, your pet will continue to get fleas. You will need to treat both your cat and the areas in which it most frequently visits to totally solve this problem.</p>

<h4>9. How do flea collars work?</h4>
<p>Flea collars work by slowly releasing the active ingredient, which has been impregnated into the collar material, over a long period of time. The active ingredient then slowly spears around the body surface of the pet in the natural oils of the skin. Flea that come into contact with the active ingredient are then killed.</p>

<h4>10. Can I catch fleas from my cat?</h4>
<p>Fleas from your pet may well bite you (often around the ankles), but they will jump off again once they have bitten you, as your blood doesn't taste right and you're probably not hairy enough! Be sure to treat the home environment, as well as your cat, to ensure you get the problem under control as quickly as possible.</p>
